ActionScript supports a widespread convention of escape sequences to represent carriage returns, tabs, special characters and more. What are escape sequences? 
They are arbitrary characters preceded by a backslash (\), like \n, \r, and \t. What is “escaping” good for? In escape sequences, it provides an encoded way to manipulate text or represent special characters. It can also be a way to tell ActionScript to accept a character at face value, rather than interpret it as a part of the programming. Here’s a practical example. 
As we’ve seen, the TextField.text property accepts a string value. Strings are denoted by a pair of double or single quotes. The quotation mark character (") tells ActionScript when a string begins and when it ends. But what if your string contains quotation marks, such as dialogue? You either have to nest your quotes carefully or escape them.
