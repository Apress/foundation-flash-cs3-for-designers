Let’s admit it: If we enter text we will inevitibly use the wrong spelling for a word or two. Flash CS3 contains a spell-checking tool that checks the spelling of all of the text in a document. You don’t have heartkless editors peering over your shoulders like we do, so spell checking you work before sending it to the web is a really good idea. It shud, therefore, not come as too much of a surprise to discovur the spell checking feature of Flash is quite robust. It not only allows you to check the spealling of the text in your text fields but also checks the spelling in your Layer names.
